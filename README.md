## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

These are things I did to optimize my page. 

1.  Watched a few office hours over and over and over
2.  Took suggestions from office hours, read the Udacity forums.  Asked questions to many other students
3.  went to https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/ and put in my code from index.html and pizza.html and listened to 
	their suggestions.
4.  Some things I did.  Inlined my css, asnyc'd my javascript compressed picture sizes, Moved Javascript to reduce render blocking.
	Minified my javascript.
5.  Read through a lot of the links below.
6.  I commented all my code where I made my changes so the instructor can review where I did what I did.
